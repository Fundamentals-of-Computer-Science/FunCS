# Fundamentals of Computer Science

Programming is about solving problems. This book shows you how.

The approach is simple: understand the data first, then compute with it. Each chapter focuses on one type of data: booleans, integers, arrays, and custom data types. For every type, you'll answer the same five fundamental questions:

1. **How do I store this data?**
2. **What operations are built in?**
3. **How does it control program behavior?**
4. **How do I define my own computations?**
5. **How do I combine this data into larger structures?**

These questions repeat every chapter. By the end of the book, you'll ask them instinctively whenever you encounter a new type.

## How This Book Teaches

Precise language matters. You'll learn exact definitions for terms and exact translations for code. When you see `bool x = true;`, you'll know to say: "Create a boolean variable named x and bind the value true to it."

Practice comes in two directions: reading code and writing code. Both are tested. After each exercise, you compare your answer to a model and note what you missed. This self-correction step isn't optional, it's where the learning happens.

If you're new here, start with Chapter 0.

## Chapters

**[[Chapter 0 - Before You Begin]]** — What programming is, how to practice, and what to expect.

**[[Chapter 1 - Booleans]]** — True and false. The simplest type, and your first pass through the five questions.

**[[Chapter 2 - Numbers]]** — Whole and decimal numbers. Arithmetic, counting loops, and numeric functions.

**[[Chapter 3 - Arrays]]** — Sequences of data. Indexing, iteration, and strings as character arrays.

**[[Chapter 4 - Classes]]** — Custom types. Modeling real things with structured data.
