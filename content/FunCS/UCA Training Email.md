Hello everyone!

I wanted to reach out to all of the 1301 UCAs for a couple of things:

First, we know that with the content in 1301 shifting, there are some things in there that you weren't taught, and therefore may want some guidance on so you can help students with it as well. To help with this we want to offer some amount of training/tutoring on the content. Of course there's already the material in D2L, and at the book site: https://fundamentals-of-computer-science.github.io/FunCS/. But in addition, I'm absolutely able to meet with you to teach any of the content you feel you are unsure of or haven't seen before. This is time you should be paid for, so this could be during your tutoring hours if you have some time where students aren't there, or we could schedule a meeting which you could of course clock in for.

(I prefer to do it outside of your tutoring hours, but I understand scheduling and going to Summerville can be a hassle or not possible outside of those hours so both can work.)

Either way, please let us know. The instructors for the courses are here to help guide you, so if you ever feel lost please reach out, we're more than happy to help!

Best,
Mark
